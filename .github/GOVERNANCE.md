## Introduction

This document outlines the governance structure for _**Astrolicious**_, hereafter referred to as "the Project." It defines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for participants and outlines the process for making decisions and managing contributions.

## Mission

_**Astrolicious**_ is an independent community organization, unaffiliated with the official Astro project or its maintainers. Our mission is to harness the collective power and creativity of our community to build and maintain a suite of resources, tools, and extensions that complement and enhance the wider ecosystem surrounding Astro. By bringing together community-driven contributions, we aim to facilitate a collaborative environment where individuals can contribute, learn, and benefit from a larger pool of shared knowledge and tools. Our goal is to foster innovation, support the growth of all contributors, and create a robust foundation that enables our community to thrive alongside the evolving landscape of web development. We are committed to inclusivity, open collaboration, and the shared success of our members, independent of, yet respectful to, the Astro project and its goals.

## Roles

Our community governance structure comprises four distinct paths: one management-focused and three focused on individual contributors (IC). This document outlines the roles within each path, eligibility, and the process for role assignment and retirement.

### Key Principles

- **Role Exclusivity**: Each community member may hold one role per path, ensuring diversity and involvement across the board.
- **Open Eligibility**: All roles are open to every community member, promoting inclusivity and participation.
- **Voluntary Participation**: Contributors can assume roles as long as they wish and may exit voluntarily at any time.
- **Role Retirement**: For details on voluntarily leaving a role or role revocation in extreme cases, refer to the ["Retiring a Role"](#retiring-a-role-alumni) section.

### Organization Management

These roles focus on overarching project management without requiring individual contributions. They cater to members steering the project's direction and health.

#### Stewards <!-- omit in toc -->

The pinnacle role overseeing the project's overall well-being, inclusivity, and sustainability. They prevent the project from being dominated by single entities. Stewards' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

#### Masterminds <!-- omit in toc -->

Known also as the "Board" or "Technical Steering Committee," they are the decision-making core, ensuring the project's and community's health. Masterminds oversee organizational decisions, affecting integrated projects but not standalone ones due to their independent nature. Mastermind' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

#### Enthusiasts <!-- omit in toc -->

Engaged members passionate about the project, acting as community ambassadors without participating in decision-making. They represent the community externally. Enthusiast' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

### Organization IC (Individual Contributors)

These roles are for members contributing directly to organization-initiated projects (e.g., Blog, Portal, Website, Infrastructure).

#### Catalysts <!-- omit in toc -->

Project administrators with the highest authority, responsible for moderation and decision-making within organizational guidelines. They are eligible for optional funding based on time, activity commitments and fund availability.

#### Pathfinders <!-- omit in toc -->

Project maintainers with autonomy to maintain projects in line with established decisions and directions. They are eligible for optional funding based on time, activity commitments and fund availability.

#### Artisans <!-- omit in toc -->

Selected contributors with the right to triage projects, requiring approval from Catalysts or Pathfinders for changes to be merged.

### Projects IC ( Individual Contributors)

This section details the roles designated for members contributing to community-integrated projects. Unlike organization-initiated projects, these roles are specific to projects that have undergone the community's submission, voting, and onboarding process. Examples include projects like `astrolicious/i18n`, `astrolicious/seeds`.

#### Pioneers <!-- omit in toc -->

Serving as the top administrators for these projects, Pioneers wield the most authority. They play a crucial role in guiding project directions and decisions. Eligibility for optional funding for Pioneers is based on several factors: time committed, activity levels, the project's share percentage, and the availability of funds.

#### Architects <!-- omit in toc -->

Architects act as project maintainers, ensuring the smooth operation and evolution of the project. Like Pioneers, Architects are eligible for optional funding, which is determined by their time commitment, activity levels, project share percentage, and fund availability.

#### Creators <!-- omit in toc -->

As essential contributors, Creators have the ability to triage projects. However, their proposed changes require approval from either a Pioneer or Architect before merging. This ensures a collaborative and quality-controlled development environment.

### Retiring a Role (Alumni)

Roles are granted for as long as the person wishes to engage with the project. However, over time an active community member may choose to step away from the project to work on other things. Moving on from a project is a natural and well-understood part of any open source community, and we celebrate it!

**Alumni** is a special designation and role for any person who had once an role assigned but is now no longer actively involved. By retiring and joining Alumni you trade-in your current set of roles, privileges, and responsibilities for a new, special Alumni role (which comes with its own set of Privileges, as described above).

You can retire your role at any time and requesting Alumni status. You can initiate this action yourself if you know ahead-of-time that you need to step away from the project. Or, if you have gone several months without interacting with the community, the project may actively reach out to you to discuss retiring as a way to make room for new members.

As an Alumni member, you are still a part of the community. You may also request to have your old roles reinstated at any time through the normal process for that role.

## Funding

Astrolicious is committed to maintaining its status as a free, MIT licensed open-source project. However, sustaining and enhancing the project requires financial support. We outline our funding mechanisms and how these funds are utilized to support the project's growth and sustainability.

### Raising Funds

Despite being a free-to-use project, Astrolicious faces significant maintenance and development challenges. Financial backing is essential for continued innovation and support.

### Eligibility

Astrolicious prioritizes the equitable distribution of funds to initiatives and contributions that significantly benefit the project and its community. In alignment with our governance structure, the eligibility for funding is directly related to the roles within the Astrolicious ecosystem. Below outlines the criteria and process for funding eligibility:

- **Role-Based Eligibility**: Funding is primarily available to individuals holding specific roles within the Astrolicious governance structure, including Pioneers, Architects, Catalysts, and Pathfinders. These roles reflect varying levels of contribution and responsibility within the project.

- **Contribution Impact**: The impact of the contribution on the Astrolicious project is a critical criterion. This includes enhancements to the project's core features, documentation, community support, and other areas that align with our strategic goals.

- **Active Participation**: Eligibility is contingent upon active and ongoing participation in the Astrolicious project. Contributors must demonstrate a sustained commitment to their roles and the project's success.

- **Project Alignment**: Requests for funding must align with the project's current needs and strategic objectives. This ensures that resources are allocated to areas of highest impact and priority.

- **Transparent Application Process**: Individuals interested in funding must submit a detailed proposal outlining the intended use of funds, expected outcomes, and how these align with the project's goals. The proposal will be reviewed by the project's stewards or the relevant governing body.

- **Accountability and Reporting**: Recipients of funding are expected to provide accountability for fund usage, including progress updates and a post-initiative report detailing the outcomes and impact on the Astrolicious project.

- **Enhancing Community Engagement**: Special consideration is given to initiatives that aim to broaden community engagement, improve diversity and inclusion, and foster a welcoming environment for new contributors.
