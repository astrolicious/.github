## Introduction

This document outlines the governance structure for _**Astrolicious**_, hereafter referred to as "the Project." It defines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for participants and outlines the process for making decisions and managing contributions.

## Mission

_**Astrolicious**_ is an independent community organization, unaffiliated with the official Astro project or its maintainers. Our mission is to harness the collective power and creativity of our community to build and maintain a suite of resources, tools, and extensions that complement and enhance the wider ecosystem surrounding Astro. By bringing together community-driven contributions, we aim to facilitate a collaborative environment where individuals can contribute, learn, and benefit from a larger pool of shared knowledge and tools. Our goal is to foster innovation, support the growth of all contributors, and create a robust foundation that enables our community to thrive alongside the evolving landscape of web development. We are committed to inclusivity, open collaboration, and the shared success of our members, independent of, yet respectful to, the Astro project and its goals.

## Roles

Our role matrix exists out of four seperated paths, one being management focused while all other three are IC (individual contributer) focused. Every member of the community can get a role granted in each of the path, but only one role per path can be held at any given time.

Roles are available to **all members** of the community!

**What things do we look for in a role candidate?**

- **Being a positive member of our community** - Go above and beyond our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and commit to healthy communication across pull requests, issue discussions, Discord conversations, and any interactions outside of our community.

All Contributor roles are granted for as long as the individual wishes to engage in given role. Contributors can voluntarily also leave the project at any time. See [Retiring a Role](#retiring-a-role-alumni) below for more information. In extreme cases a role may be revoked.

Each new Role unlocks new privileges and responsibilities. Below is a summary of our roles.

### Retiring a Role (Alumni)

Roles are granted for as long as the person wishes to engage with the project. However, over time an active community member may choose to step away from the project to work on other things. Moving on from a project is a natural and well-understood part of any open source community, and we celebrate it!

**Alumni** is a special designation and role for any person who had once an role assigned but is now no longer actively involved. By retiring and joining Alumni you trade-in your current set of roles, privileges, and responsibilities for a new, special Alumni role (which comes with its own set of Privileges, as described above).

You can retire your role at any time and requesting Alumni status. You can initiate this action yourself if you know ahead-of-time that you need to step away from the project. Or, if you have gone several months without interacting with the community, the project may actively reach out to you to discuss retiring as a way to make room for new members.

As an Alumni member, you are still a part of the community. You may also request to have your old roles reinstated at any time through the normal process for that role.

## Fundings

### Raising Funds

Astrolicious is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for Astrolicious is not sustainable without proper financial backing. We need your help to achieve this.

Learn more about sponsorship on our [Open Collective.](https://opencollective.com/astrolicious).

### Why Open Collective?

- **Full Transparency.** Everyone gets to see where money is coming from and where it's going.
- **Individual and Corporate Sponsors.** Open Collective makes it easy for both individuals and companies to sponsor open source projects.
- **Potential Tax Benefits.** Because funds are paid to the Open Source Collective, a 501(c)(6) organization in the U.S., there may be tax benefits for some donors *(please check with your accountant)*.
- **Automatic Invoicing.** For corporate sponsors, Open Collective automatically generates and sends invoices for tracking purposes.
- **Open Participation.** Anyone can request reimbursement for funds spent helping the Astrolicious project and Astrolicious can pay out to anyone.

### Distributing Funds

Every dollar spent **must** support and/or improve Astrolicious in some way. For example:

- **Swag!** Creating stickers, t-shirts, etc. for sponsors and community members.
- **Improve documentation.**
- **Improve translations.**
- **Improve website.**
- **User research.**
- **Supporting contributors.**
- **Sponsoring conferences.**
- **Sponsoring community members to represent Astrolicious at meetups, conferences, etc.**
- **Dedicated support for GitHub, Discord, Stack Overflow, etc.**
